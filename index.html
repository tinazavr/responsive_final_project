              <h4>Delicious Ukrainian Cuisine</h4>

              <p>
                Ukrainian housewives take great care of their traditions and
                culture. One of the important aspects of Ukrainian well-being is
                the national cuisine. By the way, terrorist country russia
                treacherously came to the land of my country and has been
                killing Ukrainians since 2014. They annexed our Crimea, occupied
                a large part of the territories. The territories occupied by
                russia are larger than the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPortugal, for example. The
                city in which I was born and lived for 20 years was also
                occupied. But Ukraine will win, just as good wins over evil.
                There is no Ukrainian Borsch. Borsch is Ukrainian. And russia is
                constantly trying to steal even our Borsch. That is why, for the
                first project of my studies at

                familiarize themselves with traditional Ukrainian dishes and
                learn more about my country. If you want, you can leave 5-10-50
                dollars to help my country. Links to official and reliable

              <h4>Weather app</h4>

              <p>
                This is an application that displays current weather. The
                application uses a free API from the site ,,, , google fonts and
                bootstrap. In this application, you can see the current weather
                and weather parameters. In particular, the application shows the
                weather forecast for 5 days. The nav-menu uses the cities in
                which some of the largest terrorist acts of Russia took place on
                the territory of Ukraine. You can just google any of these
                cities + "war" and see for yourself.
