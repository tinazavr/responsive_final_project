          <p>Hello world!</p>
          <p>
            My name is Nastya. I was born and raised in the south of Ukraine.
            After graduating from school, I studied physics at the

            russia deprived me of the opportunity to live at home. But it became
            an impetus to finally learn the front-end and find a job in this
            field. After February 24, the understanding appeared that I should
            move forward and decisively change my life. Therefore, since April
            2022, I started my studies again. This time in

            became the workshop where I began to understand JavaScript and
            finally understood many nuances in HTML and CSS. Before that, I had
            been interested in programming and software testing for 4-5 years.
            At different times, I tried to learn one of the programming
            languages and visited some courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, I did not believe in myself, I was afraid to start, I
            thought that I could not do anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            But... Every day since February 24, the whole world has been
            watching the steel strength and endurance of Ukrainian women and men
            who stood up to defend our common home. I had no more right to
            doubt. I had to believe in myself. I studied a lot and worked on
            myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, now I know and believe that I can do anything. Now it
            remains to find a company and a team with which we need each other
            like two pieces of a puzzle ðŸ§©.
          </p>
          <p>Maybe it's you?</p>
          <p>
            My interests and hobbies are: baking something delicious, knitting,
            travel, drive and listen to music. I love nature and most of all the
            Ukrainian Carpathians.
